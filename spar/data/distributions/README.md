# Distributions

These files are object dumps via [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html).

They seem to be various attribute distributions extracted from the alibaba trace. However no documentation of the original writers is given.

**IMPORTANT: These are scipy objects! To de-serialize them you must use the exact same scipy version as declared in Pipfile.lock** - See [Installtion](../../../README.md#installation).
